# stalkers_suck

I'm done.
Had a few really bad days.
Told HR is was resigning. Was just ready to give in to the darkness.
I feel so completely alone sometimes.
Sometimes, when I have a really bad time, I wish I still had a twitter account.
Even if it was to write depressing rants.
Fuck, even if it was to show self-harm pics, because atleast then I would feel a little less alone in the distress.
When I self-harm, it's usually because I'm having really dark thoughts and I hope none of you ever find out what's that's like, being alone in apartment with those.
I ordered a prepaid US sim card today, so I could bypass the twitter algorithm and make a new account.
It probably wouldn't have even worked, I've tried to make an account like 6 times already, I just get insta banned the moment I tweet anything.
I don't know about twitter, but I do know a stalker has gotten my blog banned.
I know he has done it many times before. Everytime I've posted pics of my chest, he reports them.. even without self-harm. 
I've had my blog put behind an adult content warning in the past, I've had posts censored.. and now I got my entire blog banned.
The same fucking stalkers that has been sending me abuse e-mails for over 3 years.
This freak is always reading everything I write. This fucking obessed jealous little man.
Probably also somehow got my twitter banned, making them believe I was "promoting self-harm/suicide", it wouldn't suprise me.
Nothing screams cowardice more then a jealous man harassing someone while hiding behind anonimity.


I'm done. I'm not going to make a new twitter account.
I'm not going to be maintaing a blog on github.
I'm not going to update my new website.
I'm just going to vanish from the internet.
This is what you people want right? 
You'll still see me on the acknowledgement page. Check this month's patch tuesday (July).
I'll still be finding bugs. And you'll still be jealous pathetic little men.

It's all your loss. 
I've learned a lot in my year since joining Microsoft.
Despite being crippled by depression.
I'll keep learning more.
But I won't ever share anything anymore.
It's not my loss. 

I'm going to include screenshots of e-mails from this stalker (the few I havn't deleted), I know he lives in the same country as me, this idiot didn't know guerilla mail actually discloses IP in the header.
I may vanish from the internet, but I'm going to put this pathetic jealous man on display first.
You know where I live, I'm not hard to find, if you ever grow some balls, come find me, I look forward to that day.

(ps: You can also thank shitheads like this for me never replying to e-mails or DMs (when I still had my twitter) .. but I do appreciate all the positives messages I've gotten in the past, even if I never replied, it's not personal, just hard to trust people on the internet)
